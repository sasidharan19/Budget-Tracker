- Providing example code snippets for Angular & Node.js
- Improving UI/UX ideas and folder structure
- Helping draft documentation (README, usage notes, testing guide)
- Clarifying best practices for deployment & API structure

### What AI Did *Not* Do
- Did *not* write the full project code
- Did *not* handle deployment
- Did *not* generate database data
- No sensitive project information was shared

### Developer Contribution
All application code, logic implementation, debugging, testing, and deployment were done by the developer.  
LLM was used only as an assistant for reference and learning.
